# Challenge-6-Weather-API
Hi!

My name is Zac Gilfoyle.

## Description
This repository contains files for a weather dashboard. On this website you can enter a city, then utilizing the OpenWeather API, will find the current weather as well as provide a 5 day forecast for that approximate location.

Along with this, the last previous weather and your previous searches will be saved and rendered onto the dashboard and also on page refresh.

This website is a demonstration of knowledge for using APIs.

Below is an image and link of the weather dashboard.
